# basic calculator in python
work in progress, just working to see how i can make an actually useful application 


## how to use:
Parameters spaced out by spaces ->  9 x 4 + 3 - 2 rt 

Operators:
  - sum: +
  - subtract: -
  - multiply: x
  - divide: /
  - exponential: xx OR ^
  - roots: rt (3 rt 4 would be ∛4)
  - toors: tr (4 tr 3 would be ∛4)

## TODO:
- Add parenthesis
- Add PEMDAS (toggleable)
- Add memory and variables
- Add holding expressions

## notes:
 you can run the python file directly or compile the launch.c file, which lets you pipe and run more efficiently (useful!)
